# bitsy-nostd-parser

Rust crate for parsing [bitsy](https://www.bitsy.org/) scripts.

This is a fork of [bitsy-parser](https://crates.io/crates/bitsy-parser) by [Max Bradbury](https://crates.io/users/synth-ruiner). I've added no-std support, fixed clippy violations and formatting issues, and removed unnecessary dependencies.
